[1] A multi-stage SEIR(D) model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea
Hee-Young Shin - Annals of Medicine - 2021
Background This paper uses a SEIR(D) model to analyse the time-varying transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea throughout its multiple stages of development. This multi-stage estimation of the model parameters offers a better model fit compared to the whole period analysis and shows how the COVID-19's infection patterns change over time, primarily depending on the effectiveness of the public health authority's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Methods This paper uses the SEIR(D) compartment model to simulate and estimate the parameters for three distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, using a manually compiled COVID-19 epidemic dataset for the period between 18 February 2020 and 08 February 2021. The paper identifies three major stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, conducts multi-stage estimations of the SEIR(D) model parameters, and carefully infers context-dependent meaning of the estimation results to help better understand the unique patterns of the transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in each stage. Results The original SIR compartment model may produce a poor and even misleading estimation result if it is used to cover the entire period of the epidemic. However, if we use the model carefully in distinctive stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, we can find useful insights into the nature of the transmission of the novel coronavirus and the relative effectiveness of the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions over time. Key messages Identifies three distinctive waves of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea. Conducts multi-stage estimations of the COVID-19 transmission dynamics using SEIR(D) epidemic models. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 vary over time, primarily depending on the relative effectiveness of the government's non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The SEIR(D) epidemic model is useful and informative, but only when it is used carefully to account for the presence of multiple waves and context-dependent infection patterns in each wave.

目的:建立可用于2019冠状病毒病(COVID-19)疫情评估的SEIR传染病动力学模型,并对湖北省COVID-19疫情进行预测和评估.方法:考虑COVID-19潜伏期患者不易被有效隔离,且具有较强的传染能力,建立了联合考虑潜伏期传播能力和追踪隔离干预措施的COVID-19 SEIR传染病动力学模型.以2020年1月23日至2月24日的湖北省疫情数据为依据,拟合得到了新建立的修正SEIR模型的动力学参数.通过欧拉数值方法实现修正SEIR传染病动力学模型的求解,对湖北省疫情进行分析,评估防控隔离和集中收治等措施对疫情发展的影响.结果:修正的SEIR传染病动力学模型对疫情的理论估计与湖北省疫情的实际情况较为符合.模型理论分析表明,防控隔离和医学追踪隔离等措施对疫情大面积传播有重要抑制作用;集中接收,分层治疗等重要措施对感染人数峰值的迅速回落起到了关键作用;此外,个人提高防范意识,采取严格自我防护措施,遏制了感染人数的新增.结论:修正的SEIR传染病动力学模型可用于COVID-19传播态势分析,以便为制订未来的疫情干预决策提供一定的理论支持.
[3] The effectiveness of quarantine and isolation determine the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in the final phase of the current outbreak in China

Objectives: Since January 23rd 2020, stringent measures for controlling the novel coronavirus epidemics have been gradually enforced and strengthened in mainland China. The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult. Methods: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. Results: Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. Conclusions: The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.
