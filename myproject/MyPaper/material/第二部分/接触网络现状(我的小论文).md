为更科学地理解病毒传播机制，接触网络（Contact Network）作为描述个体之间接触行为的有效模型，为研究传染病传播提供了新的视角[1]。通过构建节点代表个体、边表示接触关系的网络结构，可以精准刻画病毒传播路径和关键传播者，进而为边境地区疫情防控提供数据支持与策略依据。Benjamin Faucher[2]基于此方法建立了一个法国中性城镇的接触网络，探讨在因医疗物资供应不足，美国和欧洲只有60%的人接种疫苗的背景下，反应性接种是否可行，并比较其与非反应性接种对疫情控制的影响，除此之外还通过检测-追踪-隔离来进行疫情控制。研究表明，在大多数情况下，与使用相同剂量的非反应性策略相比，反应性疫苗接种可导致更高的病例减少，在疫情爆发的情况下，反应性疫苗接种如果迅速实施，得到检测-追踪-隔离的支持，可以更好地减轻传播。该研究有效的模拟了医疗物资不足时因如何实施政策并证明了其有效性，但只局限于境内病毒传播，忽视了外部传染源的介入，不能反应一个与外界有高度交流性地区的疫情传播情况。Shing Hin Yeung[3]基于接触网络构建了一个模型，研究了新南威尔士某乡村小镇中病毒传播与疫苗接种次数及接种间隔的关系，模型中人员会出境旅行并携带病毒回流。研究表明，当接触网络中的枢纽节点（即接触人数较多的个体）出现不成比例的感染时，通常预示着感染高峰即将到来。同时，研究指出最多接种三次疫苗即可有效控制COVID-19的传播，但难以实现彻底根除，病毒仍将长期作为一种地方性流行病存在。但该研究主要聚焦于相对孤立的乡村环境，接触网络仅限于小镇内部，且对境外人员感染情况采用固定概率的黑箱处理，难以有效模拟频繁跨境流动的边境地区的传播动态。

[1] A high-resolution human contact network for infectious disease transmission

The most frequent infectious diseases in humans-and those with the highest potential for rapid pandemic spread-are usually transmitted via droplets during close proximity interactions (CPIs). Despite the importance of this transmission route, very little is known about the dynamic patterns of CPIs. Using wireless sensor network technology, we obtained high-resolution data of CPIs during a typical day at an American high school, permitting the reconstruction of the social network relevant for infectious disease transmission. At 94% coverage, we collected 762,868 CPIs at a maximal distance of 3 m among 788 individuals. The data revealed a high-density network with typical small-world properties and a relatively homogeneous distribution of both interaction time and interaction partners among subjects. Computer simulations of the spread of an influenza-like disease on the weighted contact graph are in good agreement with absentee data during the most recent influenza season. Analysis of targeted immunization strategies suggested that contact network data are required to design strategies that are significantly more effective than random immunization. Immunization strategies based on contact network data were most effective at high vaccination coverage.

As vaccination against COVID-19 stalls in some countries, increased accessibility and more adaptive approaches may be useful to keep the epidemic under control. Here we study the impact of reactive vaccination targeting schools and workplaces where cases have been detected, with an agent-based model accounting for COVID-19 natural history, vaccine characteristics, individuals' demography and behaviour and social distancing. We study epidemic scenarios ranging from sustained spread to flare-up of cases, and we consider reactive vaccination alone and in combination with mass vaccination. With the same number of doses, reactive vaccination reduces cases more than non-reactive approaches, but may require concentrating a high number of doses over a short time in case of sustained spread. In case of flare-ups, quick implementation of reactive vaccination supported by enhanced test-trace-isolate practices would limit further spread. These results provide key information to promote an adaptive vaccination plan in the months to come.
